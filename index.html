With space reserved for the species who cannot speak the human languages, who are useful also to create a geo-separation from those groups who do not want to talk to the stranger anymore. This world needs changes, but we have been failing for millenia to make them top-down, by struggling to seize the central power. This page is the start of an initiative to build it all bottom-up, with or without the cooperation of the failed ruling systems.
